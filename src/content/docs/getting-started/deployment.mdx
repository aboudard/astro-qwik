# Deploy your project

You might want to deploy your Qwik project right away, now that there is very little code in the application.
This would be nice to check if it's running on a real server, rather than in dev mode on your computer.

## SSR technology involved

Qwik is a framework that supports server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box.
This means that you can deploy your Qwik project to a server and have it render the pages on the server, 
rather than in the browser.
This also means that you cannot deploy your Qwik project to a static hosting service,
as it requires a server to run the application.
